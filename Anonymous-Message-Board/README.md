1) SET NODE_ENV to `test` without quotes when ready to write tests and MONGO_URI to your database connection string (in .env)
2) Recommended to create controllers/handlers and handle routing in routes/api.js
3) You will add any security features to `server.js`
4) You will create all of the unit/functional tests in `tests/1_unit-tests.js` and `tests/2_functional-tests.js` but only functional will be tested
